## Build a Basic UI
* [Lesson](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/Lesson2.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015214-CH5-SW1)
* [Branch](https://github.com/Trii/IOS-FoodTracker/tree/01-build-a-basic-ui)
* [Diff](https://github.com/Trii/IOS-FoodTracker/pull/1/files)

This lesson gets you familiar with Xcode, the tool you use to write apps. You’ll become familiar with the structure of a project in Xcode and learn how to navigate between and use basic project components. Throughout the lesson, you’ll start making a simple user interface (UI) for the FoodTracker app and view it in Simulator. When you’re finished, your app will look something like this:

## Connect the UI to Code
* [Lesson](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/Lesson3.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015214-CH22-SW1)
* [Branch](https://github.com/Trii/IOS-FoodTracker/tree/02-connect-the-ui-to-code)
* [Diff](https://github.com/Trii/IOS-FoodTracker/pull/2/files)

In this lesson, you’ll connect the basic UI of the FoodTracker app to code and define some actions a user can perform on that UI. When you’re finished, your app will look something like this:

## Work with View Controllers
* [Lesson](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/Lesson4.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015214-CH6-SW1)
* [Branch](https://github.com/Trii/IOS-FoodTracker/tree/03-work-with-view-controllers)
* [Diff](https://github.com/Trii/IOS-FoodTracker/pull/3/files)

In this lesson, you’ll continue to work on the UI for the meal scene in the FoodTracker app. You’ll rearrange the existing UI elements and work with an image picker to add a photo to the UI. When you’re finished, your app will look something like this:

## Implement a Custom Control
* [Lesson](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/Lesson5.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015214-CH19-SW1)
* [Branch](https://github.com/Trii/IOS-FoodTracker/tree/04-implement-a-custom-control)
* [Diff](https://github.com/Trii/IOS-FoodTracker/pull/4/files)

In this lesson, you’ll implement a rating control for the FoodTracker app. When you’re finished, your app will look something like this:

## Define Your Data Model
* [Lesson](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/Lesson6.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015214-CH20-SW1)
* [Branch](https://github.com/Trii/IOS-FoodTracker/tree/05-define-your-data-model)
* [Diff](https://github.com/Trii/IOS-FoodTracker/pull/5/files)

In this lesson, you’ll define and test a data model for the FoodTracker app. A data model represents the structure of information in an app.


## Create a Table View
* [Lesson](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/Lesson7.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015214-CH8-SW1)
* [Branch](https://github.com/Trii/IOS-FoodTracker/tree/06-create-a-table-view)
* [Diff](https://github.com/Trii/IOS-FoodTracker/pull/6/files)

In this lesson, you create the main screen of the FoodTracker app. You’ll create a second, table view-based scene, that lists the user’s meals. You’ll design custom table cells to display each meal, which look like this:

## Implement Navigation
* [Lesson](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/Lesson8.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015214-CH16-SW1)
* [Branch](https://github.com/Trii/IOS-FoodTracker/tree/07-implement-navigation)
* [Diff](https://github.com/Trii/IOS-FoodTracker/pull/7/files)

In this lesson, you use navigation controllers and segues to create the navigation flow of the FoodTracker app. At the end of the lesson, you’ll have a complete navigation scheme and interaction flow for the app. When you’re finished, your app will look something like this:

## Implement Edit and Delete Behavior
* [Lesson](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/Lesson9.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015214-CH9-SW1)
* [Branch](https://github.com/Trii/IOS-FoodTracker/tree/08-implement-edit-and-delete-behavior)
* [Diff](https://github.com/Trii/IOS-FoodTracker/pull/8/files)

In this lesson, you focus on adding behavior that allows the user to edit and delete meals in the FoodTracker app.


## Persist Data
* [Lesson](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/Lesson10.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015214-CH14-SW1)
* [Branch](https://github.com/Trii/IOS-FoodTracker/tree/09-persist-data)
* [Diff](https://github.com/Trii/IOS-FoodTracker/pull/9/files)

This lesson is focused on saving a meal list across FoodTracker app sessions. Data persistence is one of the most important and common problems in iOS app development. iOS has many persistent data storage solutions; in this lesson, you’ll use NSCoding as the data persistence mechanism in the FoodTracker app. NSCoding is a protocol that enables a lightweight solution for archiving objects and other structures. Archived objects can be stored on disk and retrieved at a later time.
