## Build a Basic UI
* [Lesson](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/Lesson2.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015214-CH5-SW1)
* [Branch](https://github.com/Trii/IOS-FoodTracker/tree/01-build-a-basic-ui)
* [Diff](https://github.com/Trii/IOS-FoodTracker/pull/1/files)

This lesson gets you familiar with Xcode, the tool you use to write apps. You’ll become familiar with the structure of a project in Xcode and learn how to navigate between and use basic project components. Throughout the lesson, you’ll start making a simple user interface (UI) for the FoodTracker app and view it in Simulator. When you’re finished, your app will look something like this:

## Connect the UI to Code
* [Lesson](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/Lesson3.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015214-CH22-SW1)
* [Branch](https://github.com/Trii/IOS-FoodTracker/tree/02-connect-the-ui-to-code)
* [Diff](https://github.com/Trii/IOS-FoodTracker/pull/2/files)

In this lesson, you’ll connect the basic UI of the FoodTracker app to code and define some actions a user can perform on that UI. When you’re finished, your app will look something like this:

## Work with View Controllers
* [Lesson](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/Lesson4.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015214-CH6-SW1)
* [Branch](https://github.com/Trii/IOS-FoodTracker/tree/03-work-with-view-controllers)
* [Diff](https://github.com/Trii/IOS-FoodTracker/pull/3/files)

In this lesson, you’ll continue to work on the UI for the meal scene in the FoodTracker app. You’ll rearrange the existing UI elements and work with an image picker to add a photo to the UI. When you’re finished, your app will look something like this:

## Implement a Custom Control
* [Lesson](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/Lesson5.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015214-CH19-SW1)
* [Branch](https://github.com/Trii/IOS-FoodTracker/tree/04-implement-a-custom-control)
* [Diff](https://github.com/Trii/IOS-FoodTracker/pull/4/files)

In this lesson, you’ll implement a rating control for the FoodTracker app. When you’re finished, your app will look something like this:

## Define Your Data Model
* [Lesson](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/Lesson6.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015214-CH20-SW1)
* [Branch](https://github.com/Trii/IOS-FoodTracker/tree/05-define-your-data-model)
* [Diff](https://github.com/Trii/IOS-FoodTracker/pull/5/files)

In this lesson, you’ll define and test a data model for the FoodTracker app. A data model represents the structure of information in an app.


## Create a Table View
* [Lesson](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/Lesson7.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015214-CH8-SW1)
* [Branch](https://github.com/Trii/IOS-FoodTracker/tree/06-create-a-table-view)
* [Diff](https://github.com/Trii/IOS-FoodTracker/pull/6/files)

In this lesson, you create the main screen of the FoodTracker app. You’ll create a second, table view-based scene, that lists the user’s meals. You’ll design custom table cells to display each meal, which look like this:
