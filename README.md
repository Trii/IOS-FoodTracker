## Build a Basic UI
* [Lesson](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/Lesson2.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015214-CH5-SW1)
* [Code](https://github.com/Trii/IOS-FoodTracker/pull/1/files)

This lesson gets you familiar with Xcode, the tool you use to write apps. You’ll become familiar with the structure of a project in Xcode and learn how to navigate between and use basic project components. Throughout the lesson, you’ll start making a simple user interface (UI) for the FoodTracker app and view it in Simulator. When you’re finished, your app will look something like this:

## Connect the UI to Code

* [Code](https://github.com/Trii/IOS-FoodTracker/pull/2/files)

In this lesson, you’ll connect the basic UI of the FoodTracker app to code and define some actions a user can perform on that UI. When you’re finished, your app will look something like this:

## Work with View Controllers

* [Lesson](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/Lesson4.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015214-CH6-SW1)
* [Code](https://github.com/Trii/IOS-FoodTracker/pull/3/files)

In this lesson, you’ll continue to work on the UI for the meal scene in the FoodTracker app. You’ll rearrange the existing UI elements and work with an image picker to add a photo to the UI. When you’re finished, your app will look something like this:
